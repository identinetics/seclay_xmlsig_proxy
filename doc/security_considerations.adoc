= Security Considerations

== Cross-site scripting (XSS)

User input is expected only in the URL parameter values of the initial invocation.
These values are escaped in sig_proxy_server.py/_sanitize()

sign_proxy_client.js writes the DOM in following locations:

|===
| source                  | event                  | safeguard
| load_termination_page() | document.location      | location is whitelisted by sig_proxy_server.py
| write_status()          | messagebox.innerHTML = | content escaped + source not from user
|===


== Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Using the Encryption based Token Pattern, server-encrypted tokens are exchanged with POST requests.
The tokens have fixed names (csrftoken4proxy and csrftoken4webapp).
Token values include a nonce and time stamp, and when validated in the POST handler must show a valid text and age after dcryption.
